=head1 NAME

Math::SimpleHisto::XS::Named - Named histograms for Math::SimpleHisto::XS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::SimpleHisto::XS::Named;
  my $hist = Math::SimpleHisto::XS::Named->new(
    names => [qw(boys girls)],
  );
  $hist->fill('boys', 12);
  $hist->fill($_) for map $_->gender, @kids;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<EXPERIMENTAL>

This module provides histograms with named bins. It is built on top of
L<Math::SimpleHisto::XS> and attempts to provide the same interface as
far as it makes sense to support. The following documentation covers only
the differences between the two modules, so a basic familiarity with
C<Math::SimpleHisto::XS> is required.

It is important to not attempt to use a histogram with named bins by looking
at its internal coordinates or bin numbering.

=head1 API DIFFERENCES TO Math::SimpleHisto::XS

=head2 Constructors

The regular constructor, C<new> requires one named parameter: C<names>,
an array reference of bin names.

The C<clone>, C<new_alike> methods work the same as with C<Math::SimpleHisto::XS>,
but the C<new_from_bin_range>, and C<new_alike_from_bin_range> methods are B<not>
implemented for named histograms.

=head2 Filling Histograms

The C<fill()> method normally takes any of the following parameters:

=over 2

=item *

A single coordinate to fill into the histogram

=item *

A single coordinate followed by a single weight

=item *

An array reference containing coordinates to fill
into the histogram

=item *

Two array references of the same array length, the
first of which contains coordinates, the second of which
contains the respective weights

=back

The C<fill()> method has been overridden in such a way that wherever
the interface normally calls for coordinates, you need to pass in bin
names instead.

Effectively, that means C<fill> works much like C<fill_by_bin> for named
histograms.

=head2 Additional Methods

This class provides a C<get_bin_names()> method which returns
a list of bin names in storage order.

=head2 Unimplemented Methods

Apart from the aforementioned C<new_from_bin_range> and C<new_alike_from_bin_range>
methods, the following are not implemented, generally, because they do not
apply to named bins:

C<find_bin>, C<min>, C<max>, C<binsize>, C<width>, C<integral>, C<rand>
C<bin_center>, C<bin_lower_boundary>, C<bin_upper_boundary>,
C<bin_centers>, C<bin_lower_boundaries>, C<bin_upper_boundaries>

=head2 Methods With Bin Number Parameters

Methods that normally take a bin number as the first parameter,
require a bin name instead. These are:

C<bin_content>, C<set_bin_content>, C<fill_by_bin>.

=head2 Serialization

This class implements the C<dump()> and C<new_from_dump()> methods
of the C<Math::SimpleHisto::XS> interface by wrapping the histogram dump
in JSON which contains the additional information.

If you always stick to using C<dump()> and C<new_from_dump()>, then this
is an implementation details that should not matter to your code.

The C<Storable> freeze/thaw hooks are delegated to the C<Math::SimpleHisto::XS>
implementation and should work as is.

The serialization wrapping does not currently handle dumping/loading dumps
in the same backwards compatible way that C<Math::SimpleHisto::XS> does.
Since there are no version-incompatibilities in the
C<Math::SimpleHisto::XS::Named> code yet, this is not currently an issue
and will be addressed when the first incompatibility pops up.
